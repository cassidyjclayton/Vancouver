		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>
			My name is Lingling Li, and my English name is Lily. I come from Shanghai, China. I love playing the piano, drawing, cooking and playing badminton. I’m now a sophomore, and also the D’Lion in charge of Gates 6 and Gannett 6. My job is to help the first year students better adjust to college life, and to be their first friend in college. I’m planning to double major in Business and Digital Media Studies, and minor in Japanese.
		</p>

		<h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
		<p>
			I come from Shanghai, China, which is a modern and beautiful city. The place I missed the most is the park near my kindergarten. When I was age 4 when most of my peer had attended the kindergarten and start their "academic year", I on the other hand was still playing or in other words "studying"at home. My parents think that family education is better for a young kid than attending the class in the kindergarten, although the "family education"is not as popular in China as in America. I thank my parents a lot for letting me have this experience.
		</p>

		<p>
			I have taken almost all pre-request course of my major. Among all of the classes, JPN101 is my favorite class. I tried to maintain my class credits with in 24, but there have too much interesting stuff I want to have a try in the college, so I overload again. I hope I can succeed in this year’s academic study.
		</p>
		<p>
			I love to play the piano and am currently taking lessons in Eastman music school. I started to learn piano (as well as my painting) when I was in Kindergarten. Yes! Kindergarten again! But it was not until I attend the piano lesson in Eastman, did I start to love playing the piano. The teacher in Eastman simply overturned everything I thought I knew about the piano and how to practice the piano. "You must think the piano as an assembled collection of instruments”, my teacher said. I started to explore the unique tone quality of different region on the keyboard, and that makes me really excited. Just imagine! You can play as a band while you are just actually playing the single instrument!
		</p>

		<p>
			Besides the piano, I'm also trying to explore my skill's possibility! I love painting and designing and have an intern this summer as a graphic designer in a Fin-tech company. For the sports, I love play badminton, and successfully managed to realize my goal settled at the beginning of last semester to cover 4 hours of sports every week. This semester, I want to explore the dancing area! I registered the "Rice Crew"club to have a taste of K-pop dancing. I'm also trying to do something for the community. I passed the elections to be a D'Lion this year on Gate 6 and Gannett 6, aiming to help the first-year students move into the campus and acted as a student leader on behalf on the "social sprit”.

		<h2> Experience </h2>
		

		<h2> Goals</h2>
		
		<p>
				For my academic career: I might return to China and work for some years. After I gain some savings and accumulate some life experience, I might return to school again. I might go to more countries to finish my graduate education. I plan to stay in Australia, England, German to have my graduate education. I believe the time being a student is the happiest time in life for you to enjoy the world, enjoy the travel and enjoy the knowledge. After the graduate school, I might return to work for several years, and might try to start my own business.
