      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello there! My name is Kevin Kao. I was born in New York, but gre up in Thailand during much of my adolescence! I am currently a sophomore double majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Rochester.  Here I would like to share what triggers me to become a computer scientist and why I love technology so much!
      </p>


      <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
      <p>
        When I was four years old, I had severe pneumonia, for which I stayed in the ICU for two weeks. When I was seven, I had an asthma attack on the running track during elementary school. I was taken to the ER to be treated with a nebulizer. In both cases, I would not have survived without the care of doctors, nurses, parents, and more importantly, the advanced medical technology that made treatment possible. Since then, I was determined to improve human life with technology. Technology has saved my life twice.
      </p>

      <p> 
        I studied in Taiwan for primary and secondary education, before coming to the University of Rochester. I have a strong interest in the field of science, and I have taken many courses related to my majors (Computer Science and Mathematics) last year. For example, I took <em>CSC (170, 171, 172)</em> and <em>MTH (150, 165, 171, 172)</em>. In addition to that, I am now taking <em>CSC (173, 174, 214)</em> and <em>MTH (173, 190, 201)</em> to better prepare me for my career. I am minoring in Physics, and expect to graduate in 2021


       <p>
       As the pioneer institution in advanced research and innovation, Hajim School of Engineering will be the perfect place for my exploratory journey to become a great engineer. I would expose myself to the many different fields of engineering by taking advantage of the wide selection of courses and learning from the world-class faculty at the School of Engineering. While the exceptional academic program will prepare me with a solid knowledge foundation, the abundant research and internship opportunities would allow me to apply and experiment the knowledge alongside with prominent professors and industry leaders.
      </p>

      <h2>Experience</h2>


      <p>
       As the founder of Math Team and member of Engineering Club at my high school, I created a supportive learning environment to tackle interesting math problems and build robots outside of the classroom with peers who shared the same passion. I enjoy putting ideas into actions and learning through peer-led collaboration. I was excited when I have learned about hackathon, a platform for programmers to collaborate with each other and create an interesting project under twenty-four hours! My friend and I went to the hackathon at Syracuse University last semester, and, although the result was not ideal, I made several friends there and gained tons of fun and excitements! I firmly believe that those two days we spent there were worthwhile for my mundane freshman year.
      </p>

      <h2>Goals</h2>

      <p>
       When I think of the University of Rochester, I think of thousands of patients such as myself who has or may suffer from potentially fatal infections or acute asthma attacks. I think of the technology-enabled medical techniques that literally saved millions of lives. I think of an inspiration-filled atmosphere that perpetually battles at the forefront of breakthrough innovation. And I think of a world-class institution where I believe would be the best place for me to study as an engineer and as a leader, allowing me to be bold to dream and to be strong to lead! My goal, one day, is to be a computer scientist and engineer, and use technology to help others the same way it helped me!
